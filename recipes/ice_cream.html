    <ol>
        <li>Locate your nearest italian caf√©</li>
        <li>Go up to the ice cream counter</li>
        <li>For the first few words of the order, try to speak confidently and order some gelato, before you realize that you have some social anxiety</li>
        <li>Forget the names of your favorite flavors. Instead use your finger and order some of "this" and "uhhh that"</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't forget to keep your budget in mind. You should only order at max the number of scoops of your favorite "uhhh that" that you can pay for</li>
