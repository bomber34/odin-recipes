    <p>If Italy is known for one thing, it is <strong>pizza</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a dish that can be eaten for lunch, dinner and for <em>students</em>, even for breakfast.</p>
    <p>But the creation of a delicious <strong>pizza</strong> is some science in itself.</p>
    <p>With this recipe, you can extingiush your lusting thoughts for pizza very quickly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A scissor</li>
            <li>A Freezer or a supermarket</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>How to achieve a <em>warm</em> pizza</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Check your freezer. Any good households have at least 5 frozen pizzas for emergencies in their freezer.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are brave, you can also check behind your fridge for a yummy good good.</li>
            <li>In the unlikely event that there is no pizza, locate the nearest super market and buy a frozen pizza there.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Get your scissor to open the plastic wrapping that divides you from the important food item</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You may be tempted to eat your pizza now but beware, it is a lot more tastier and easy to chew if it is not frozen</li>
        </ul>
        <li><p>Put the pizza into the oven. You can either preheat or heat the pizza together with your oven.</p>
        <p>Some people have terrible ovens, others are misguided by the paradox of the preheated oven, some just choose to follow any order they find on the back of a package.</p>
        <p><i>Just be brave, explore new ideas</i>. At the very least, get the pizza into a hotter state than it was in the freezer</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the cheese is melted and the crust turns browner than it was after it was deeply frozen, get the pizza out of the oven.</p>
        <p>Some people have special tools for that. Any student knows however, that you can get a pizza out with almost anything. A go to device for <em>them</em> is the spork.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it. Italy's biggest "accomplishment" done in like 15 to 30 minutes or so.</p>
